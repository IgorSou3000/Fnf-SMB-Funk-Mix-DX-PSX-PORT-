This is a list and coordinates of the level loop sprites
it starts at sprite 0 (below, in level1.png), and ends with sprite 6
the sprites are supposed to be layed out RIGHT TO LEFT (1 is to the left of 0, for example)
most of the sprites are of equal size, except for sprite 0, which is 2 pixels less wide.

Also, none of the destructable props are in these sprites (bricks, pipes, ect.)
the main stage should probably be focused on before adding that.

LASTLY! when the loop first begins (right after MX laughs) start the loop at 1 instead of 0
but make it loop back to 0 afterwords.
